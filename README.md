Design and construct a relational database that can be deployed in a commercial db management system

A relational database that can be deployed in a commercial db management system is designed for a dental practice in a small town. The dentist can treat most cases, although some specialist cases are referred to larger practices where the required expertise and equipment are available.

The business rules of the practice are developed and implemented via the database schema and queries as follows:

1. Relational Schema
  a. Tables
  b. Attributes
  c. Primary Keys
  d. Foreign Keys
  e. Constraints
     i. Primary Key
    ii. Range
   iii. Value
   
2. Test Data

3. Queries
  a. Select
  b. Insert
  c. Update
  d. Delete
  e. Create
  
The database created is then used to demonstrate Codd's rules
